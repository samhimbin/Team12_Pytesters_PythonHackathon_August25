This dataset is designed to analyze the relationship between lifestyle behaviors (activity, sleep, diet) and glucose regulation in diabetic patients.

It could be used for:

•	Predicting blood glucose fluctuations.

•	Optimizing insulin dosing.

•	Studying the impact of sleep and physical activity on glucose control.

•	Research on wearable device data integration in diabetes management.


**Core features of the dataset**:

**1.	Time-series physiological and behavioral data:**

o	**time** — timestamps, indicating longitudinal tracking.

o	**glucose** — CGM readings (mg/dL), central to diabetes management.

o	**heart_rate, steps, calories** — wearable-tracked physiological metrics.

o	**basal_rate and bolus_volume_delivered** — insulin delivery data (common in insulin pump therapy).

o	**carb_input** — carbohydrate intake, relevant for insulin dosing.


**2.Demographics & lifestyle factors:**

o	**Patient_ID, Age, Gender, Race** — patient identifiers and demographic variables.

o	**Sleep-related metrics:** Average Sleep Duration, Sleep Quality, % with Sleep Disturbances — could help study how sleep affects glucose control.
